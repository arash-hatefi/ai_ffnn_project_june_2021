# Design and Train a Fully-Connected Feed-Forward Neural Network
Project for the Artificial Intelligence undergraduate course at the University of Tehran, Designed by Arash Hatefi, Hamid Khodadadi, and Sina Negarandeh (June 2021).

## About the Code
Follow the instructions on the project and notebook descriptions to implement and train a fully-connected feed-forward neural network. 

## About the Dataset
The project's aim was initially to train a fully-connected feed-forward neural network on the feedKuzushiji-MNIST dataset (for more information and download [click here](https://github.com/rois-codh/kmnist)). However, when completed, one can use the code to classify any arbitrary dataset.
